I'm Arijit Das, a uni student doing masters in Physics from India. I can't remember it clearly, but my first time in programming language was when I was in sixth grade. It was most probably BASIC and I didn't like computer prgramming that much at that time(bcuz I didn't really understand what were we doing). But in uni I was getting interested into programming, we had to do some coding for physics tho.
